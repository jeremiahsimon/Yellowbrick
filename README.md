My role as a Software Engineer include developing features that provide agents a platform to customize financial plan proposals to address clients' unique needs. The features I built provide agents the capability to browse an interactive directory of providers, obtain policy pricing to build plan packages, and allow sysadmins to manage companies in the database. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities:

- Build and integrate **RESTful APIs** within **.NET Framework**, and use **Postman** to organize API requests into
collections and workspaces making it easier to manage and share sets of related requests.
- Develop a **SQL** database to synchronize and manage the dynamic interplay between product proposals and
company data through the use of tables, relationships, indexes, stored procedures and foreign key constraints.
- Implement **AWS** S3 storage file upload SDKs to enable users to send, share, and store files on a server or cloud
storage.
- Create product and company forms enabling financial agents to submit provider information and policies into the
database. Utilized **Formik** and **Yup** to enforce data validation.
- Utilized **React** and **AJAX/Axios** to fetch real-time company and product data from APIs, providing dynamic JSON
strings for interactive viewing of proposals enhancing the user experience for agents and clients.
- Enhanced application usability by introducing pagination and a dynamic form with sorting functionalities to
simplify search and navigation.
- Establish consistent UI components tailored for forms and breadcrumbs for uniformity by leveraging **Bootstrap**,
**jQuery**, and custom CSS styling.
- Regularly analyze code to identify, test, and fix bugs and improve bad code for reusability and better
performance.
- Engage in agile development by doing daily stand ups to go over goals, using **Trello** to develop sprints to
complete work in a specified time, and interact with clients to discuss new functionality for the project.
- Use **Git** for version control to properly merge code through GitHub after successful peer code reviews to
maintain coding standards within the **CI/CD** pipeline.
